--- End of the day: Dreaming away ---

It happens that you have some time off for once.  
So you climb up in a place close-by where you can have a good overview of the surroundings.  
While you are looking at the elfes moving and working all over the place,  
your brain slowly starts to dream away.

You are actually thinking to all the possible gifts that you would not really want (your puzzle input)
You try to thinkg how you could react if that would ever happen and you categorize the gift.

- Alternative gift
- Ugly gifts (The file has wrong format basicaly)
- Malfunctionning gifts (Some expectation on the exercice is not fullfiled, might be part dependent)
- Discutable gifts (Depending on interpretation of the exercice, it can be valid or invalid)
